Description: # Introduction
        
        Client Tracker is a Django app to keep track of clients visiting your website. 
        Client IP, and location is fetched using a client-side script. It keeps track of
        how long users stay on your site. Users don't need to login on your site for this
        to work. Please make sure that you inform the users that the site uses cookies as
        it is required for this application.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        - Django 2.0+
        
        ## Installation
        
        - Copy "clienttracker" application to your project folder 
        - Add "clienttracker" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'clienttracker',
            ]
        - Include the clienttracker URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
            path('ticker/', include('clienttracker.urls'))
        - Run "python manage.py migrate" to create the clienttracker models.
        - Include tracer.js in base.html at the bottom of the page. If you do not use base.html you will need
           to include the js in every html file separately.
           
           <script src="{% static 'js/tracer.js' %}"></script>
        - Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/. 
        
        ## Known Problems
        
        - As of now the data is not represented in any format, it is only saved in database.
        - There is an issue with logging (inside views.py) which was identified when it was put in pythonanywhere.com. Logging was removed from it since.
